🎯 Guess the Number Game

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript console game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number. At the start, the user provides a custom maximum value, and the game generates a secret number within that range. The player then attempts to guess the number while receiving helpful hints:

"Too high" if the guess is above the number

"Too low" if the guess is below the number

"Correct!" when the guess matches the secret number

The game also handles invalid inputs and allows the user to exit anytime by typing "quit".
It’s a simple mini-project demonstrating loops, conditionals, input validation, and basic JavaScript logic.
